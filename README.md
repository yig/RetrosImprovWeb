# The Retros New Web Site

This is a Jekyll site. See https://jekyllrb.com/.

You can install Jekyll locally to develop locally and preview changes. (`rbenv install 3.4.6` once, then `rbenv shell 3.4.6` then `gem install bundler` then `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve`). GitHub automatically re-builds the content whenever you push a commit.

If you want to edit content, edit these files:

For HTML layout and copy:

+ \_layouts/*
+ \_includes/*

For People and Shows:

+ \_config.yml

For fonts and colors:

+ \_data/template.yml

The Jekyll theme is called Agency (https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/agency-jekyll-theme) with some minor edits.
