Washington, DC was founded on land donated by Virginia and Maryland in 1801.
The city had the shape of a beautiful diamond. Today, there is a bite missing
from that diamond. That happened in the 1840's. The historical event which
returned Virginia's part of the diamond was called Retrocession. That includes
Alexandria, the home of the Retrocessionists.
